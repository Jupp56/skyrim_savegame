# skyrim_savegame
A rust library with data structures representing a skyrim savegame and the capability to load a savegame.

This is work in progress and not complete!

Missing:
* Papyrus data

Some things will never get parsed properly, as the the information about the data layout is not available.
The data source regarding the file format is the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, found [here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_Mod:Save_File_Format)
